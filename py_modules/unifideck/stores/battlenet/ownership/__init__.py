"""Battle.net ownership and installed-state — public surface.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/battlenet/ownership/__init__.py

The playable catalog is not a list Blizzard hands out; it is the result of
evaluating the PUB catalog's rules against account facts:

  ``licenses.py``    licence ids from ``CachedData.db`` (plain SQLite)
  ``pub_catalog.py`` merges the cached PUB catalog fragments (plain JSON)
  ``rules.py``       evaluates the rules -> the products actually granted
  ``installed.py``   ``aggregate.json`` (+ ``product.db``) for install state

Both account fact sources are needed and neither is sufficient. Licences
alone miss every free-to-play and subscription title, because those match
on ``game_account`` rather than ``license_id``; ``games-and-subs`` alone
misses everything purchased. Measured 2026-08-09 on one account: licences
resolved 9 families, game accounts contributed 5 more.

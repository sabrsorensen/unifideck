"""services/bootstrap/store_injector.py — Post-discovery store DI.

Cross-service dependency injection that runs AFTER both
``auto_discover`` (instantiates stores with minimal signature)
and ``bootstrap_services`` (builds the container). Walks
``_STORE_INJECTIONS`` and ``setattr``'s each mapping onto the
live store instance.

Rationale for late injection: ``auto_discover`` is a generic
scanner that knows nothing of store-specific Layer-5 deps.
Rather than expand its signature to accept every possible kwarg,
we keep ``auto_discover`` uniform and do specialised wiring here.

Refactor history (2026-05-14): ``inject_store_dependencies`` was
a single function at CC=16 — a double ``for store / for mapping``
loop with three separate failure paths (``registry.get`` raising
``KeyError``, raising another exception, or returning ``None``),
plus another failure path on ``setattr`` (``__slots__`` /
frozen). Split into three helpers so the main loop reads as
"for each store, resolve, then wire each mapping, then rebuild
auth if applicable".

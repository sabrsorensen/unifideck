"""scripts/validate_event_schemas.py — CI guard for event kwargs.

Static-analysis gate that keeps every ``bus.emit(Events.X, ...)``
call site honest. It walks the whole backend, collects the union
of kwargs passed to each event, and compares that against the
declared contract in ``CANONICAL_SCHEMA``. Any mismatch
(unexpected kwarg, or an event emitted but never declared) fails
the CI.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/validate_event_schemas.py
    echo $?   # 0 = clean, 1 = mismatches, 2 = error

Add to .github/workflows/ before the pytest step. When adding a
new event:
  1. add it to the ``Events`` enum (core/types/events.py),
  2. add its kwargs contract to ``CANONICAL_SCHEMA`` below,
  3. run this script.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Why the schema is validated against the enum
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
``SchemaExtractor`` extracts the *event name* from the first
positional argument of every ``.emit()`` / ``.enqueue()`` call.
It accepts two shapes (``Events.SOMETHING`` and a string literal)
and explicitly "can't follow data flow" for anything else.

That last point bites in two ways, both handled here:

  * ``bus.emit(item.event, **item.kwargs)`` in the priority
    dispatcher is an ``ast.Attribute`` whose ``.attr`` is the
    literal string ``"event"`` — the extractor cannot tell it
    apart from ``Events.GAME_STOPPED``. Without filtering it
    surfaces a phantom event named ``event``.
  * ``SECURITY_*`` events are emitted through wrappers
    (``_emit_security_event``, ``audit_emitter``) rather than a
    direct ``Events.X`` literal, so the extractor never sees
    them. They are intentionally absent from CANONICAL_SCHEMA:
    the ``compare`` loop skips events with no observed emit
    (``seen is None``), so declaring them would be dead weight,
    and declaring them with guessed kwargs would be worse.

The robust fix for the first problem is to treat the ``Events``
enum as the source of truth: any extracted name that is not a
real enum member is extraction noise (a variable, an object
attribute, a generic re-emit) and is dropped before comparison.
A start-up check also asserts every CANONICAL_SCHEMA key is a
real enum member, so a typo / renamed / deleted event fails
loudly instead of silently never matching.

"""StoreRPCMixin — store auth + login-state RPC.

Covers the auth surface only. The neighbouring surfaces live in
sibling mixins, all composed onto ``Plugin`` in ``main.py``:

* library and sync — ``SyncRPCMixin``;
* install and update — ``DownloadRPCMixin``;
* auth-shortcut context (``get_<store>_auth_shortcut_context``,
  ``get_compat_tool_for_game``) — ``AuthShortcutsRPCMixin``, split
  out to keep this file under the 200 LOC ceiling.

Composition is flat: every mixin is a base of ``Plugin`` and reaches
its dependencies through ``self``. There is no handler-group layer and
no ``rpc/handlers/`` package; earlier versions of this docstring
described a structure that was never built.

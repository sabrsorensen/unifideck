"""Reconcile phases mixin — bulk shortcut sync from a library snapshot.

Extracted from ``games_map_mixin.py`` (2026-05-17) to keep the
host file under the 550 LOC volumetry cap. Contains the bulk
reconcile method + its five phase helpers — the set-diff
algorithm that adds missing shortcuts, removes stale ones, and
reclaims orphaned entries by AppID from the persistent registry.

The "is this row stale" decision itself lives in ``stale_predicate.py``
(split out 2026-08-26, same cap): it is pure, it is the most destructive
call in the package, and it was already being tested directly.

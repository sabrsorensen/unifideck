"""Amazon Games installer — install / uninstall pipeline using nile.

``AmazonInstaller`` orchestrates installs and uninstalls via the
``nile`` CLI. The install pipeline :

1. **preflight** — verify nile binary, resolve base path, build the
   install context;
2. **probe** — query nile for the game's manifest (size, fuel.json
   location, supported architectures);
3. **subprocess** — spawn nile with structured progress callbacks
   (parses nile's stdout for "downloaded X/Y bytes" lines);
4. **finalize** — parse the fuel.json from ``amazon_fuel.py``
 to extract the launch executable, write the
   ``.unifideck-id`` marker, register with the install registry.

The uninstall path is symmetric : remove install dir, drop registry
entry, clean up shortcut + artwork cache.

Errors are wrapped into typed ``InstallResult`` envelopes ; partial
installs are cleaned up to avoid leaving orphaned files on disk.

"""Build the Battle.net library from client-local state.

py_modules/unifideck/stores/battlenet/library.py

Joins the three sources the Phase 0 spike identified::

    licences (CachedData.db)  ─┐
                               ├─> PUB catalog rules ─> playable programs
    game accounts (web/opt)   ─┘
                                        │
    aggregate.json + product.db ────────┴─> installed overlay

Both fact sources are required. Licences alone miss every free-to-play and
subscription title, because those match on ``game_account`` rather than
``license_id``; the web endpoint alone misses everything purchased.
Measured on one real account: licences gave 17 programs, licences plus game
accounts gave 22, and every one resolved to a name and an install uid.

The library is keyed on the **uid**, not the family code. A uid is stable
(``fenris`` has never changed) while Blizzard renames families — Diablo IV
went ``D4`` -> ``Fen`` in 2026 — and the Steam app id is derived from
``store_game_id``, so a re-key would silently orphan the user's shortcut,
playtime, categories and artwork.

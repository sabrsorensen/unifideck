"""Validate the Unifideck architecture invariants that keep drifting.

Several silent drifts have recurred through the 0.7.x series and are worth
machine-enforcing rather than re-discovering by hand every release:

1. The RPC mixin set was documented inconsistently: at the 2026-08 audit
   ``main.py``'s docstring said "eleven", ``rpc/mixins/__init__.py``
   re-exported 13, and the docs said 18, against a class that composed 20.
   The one invariant that matters is that ``main.py``'s composed mixins and
   ``__init__.py``'s ``__all__`` agree; that is check 1, and it is the only
   place the set is stated. Check 5 keeps it that way (see below).

2. The store list drifts (docs said "five stores" long after Battle.net
   became the sixth). ``bootstrap/cache_registry._STORE_CACHES`` is the
   single code source of truth; it must match the store subdirectories
   on disk.

3. A store's ``StoreInfo.name`` must match its directory, since the registry
   auto-discovers by directory and every other check keys on that name.

   This check used to have a second arm, comparing each store's
   ``StoreInfo(uses_wine=...)`` against ``WRAPPER_STORES``. Audit §3.1 asked
   for that link; re-deriving it found ``uses_wine`` had no reader anywhere,
   so the gate was enforcing agreement on a value that could not change
   behaviour. The field is gone and ``get_store_infos`` derives
   ``client_runs_in_prefix`` from ``WRAPPER_STORES``, which makes the arm
   unfailable — a re-added literal now raises ``TypeError`` at construction.
   Check 9 replaces it with the wrapper-store link that was actually
   unguarded.

4. RPC methods accumulate with no frontend caller. The 2026-08 audit found
   29 of 102 — 28% of the surface — including a whole "DiagnosticsPanel"
   that was never built. This check *used* to be report-only and asked only
   "does the snake_case name appear anywhere in ``src/`` text", which missed
   14 of the 29: a method declared in ``rpcRoutes`` whose constant nothing
   references passed. It now asks both questions and is a hard gate.

   Opt out per method with an inline ``# no-frontend-caller: <reason>``
   comment on the ``async def`` line or the line above it. The reason lives
   next to the code rather than in an allowlist file, and the exemption
   count is printed on every run so growth is visible rather than silent.

5. A mixin count written into prose goes stale on the next mixin churn, and
   check 1 cannot see it. This happened three times in 0.7.x: audit §2.1
   found four disagreeing figures, the remediation hand-corrected them all
   to 20, and the §1.2 dead-RPC pass then deleted three empty mixins in the
   same release, making every corrected site wrong again. Correcting the
   number is the approach that failed; not writing it down is check 5.

   The set is enumerated in exactly two places, both machine-checked by
   check 1: ``main.py``'s ``class Plugin(...)`` and ``__init__.py``'s
   ``__all__``. Everywhere else must name the source rather than the figure.

   Opt out with an inline ``mixin-count-ok: <reason>`` marker on the line or
   the line above it, for a deliberate historical citation. Same convention
   as ``# no-frontend-caller:`` above and ``# unwired:`` in
   ``validate_event_wiring.py``: the reason lives next to the text.

6. A layer count written into prose has the same failure mode, and audit §2.2
   found four mutually contradictory ones, two of them saying "five" while
   enumerating six. The diagram in ``docs/architecture.md`` is the single
   enumeration. Banned like the mixin count; opt out with
   ``layer-count-ok: <reason>``.

7. A store count in prose is *verified* rather than banned, which is the one
   place these checks differ. Many live sites state a count correctly while
   explaining something, so the figure is compared against the store
   directories on disk and only a wrong one fails. Only a total claim is
   examined ("all N stores", "N store connectors"), because a count below the
   total is nearly always naming a subset. Opt out with
   ``store-count-ok: <reason>``.

8. A subpackage missing from the layer map reads as nonexistent to whoever
   plans the next change. Audit §2.5 found the tables listing 6 of 20
   ``core/`` modules and 10 of 15 ``services/`` packages, with
   ``compatibility`` (the ProtonDB path) and ``support_bundle`` (Capture
   Logs) both invisible. Check 8 asserts membership rather than trusting a
   hand-maintained table, since those drift exactly the way a count does.

9. Adding a wrapper store means adding a row in several hand-written
   dispatch maps, and a missing row fails silently rather than loudly. The
   Python-side maps are pinned by tests (``wrapper_prefix_probe._SPECS``,
   ``tests/unit/test_wrapper_store_dispatch_coverage.py``); the frontend's
   ``CLIENT_STOREFRONTS`` in ``services/store/StorefrontLauncher.ts`` is not
   reachable from pytest, so it is checked here. A wrapper store missing
   from it makes the cart button do nothing at all — no error, no toast.

10. A store can declare where its vendor client writes logs and then never
    salvage them. Audit §3.3 filed this as redundancy ("only Battle.net
    consumes ``prefix_forensics``"); re-deriving it found a complete, measured
    Ubisoft row in ``VENDOR_LOG_GLOBS`` that nothing called, so every failed
    Ubisoft install deleted UPC's own logs with the prefix — for a wrapper
    store the prefix *is* the install. This is the audit's most repeated
    defect class: the material shipped, the delivery channel was never
    built. Check 10 asks whether the store's **own package** calls
    ``preserve_vendor_logs``, so one store cannot vouch for another. Opt out
    with ``# no-vendor-salvage: <reason>``.

11. A helper promoted into ``stores/shared/`` gets copied back. Audit §3.4
    found five helpers pasted across stores; three had diverged, and one
    divergence was live — Epic's and Amazon's ``merge_install_status``
    guarded their disk-existence check on the path being truthy, so a
    record with a blank path skipped it and marked a deleted game
    installed. Promotion alone does not prevent the next copy, and a grep
    for the name finds the shared one and reads as covered. Check 11 pins
    each promoted helper to its owning module. Opt out with
    ``# intentional-divergence: <reason>``.

Checks 5 to 7 share one scanner, ``scan_prose``. Their regexes are narrow on
purpose and each carries the false positive that shaped it: a gate that fires
on correct, untouched code gets switched off rather than fixed. See the
comment above each pattern, and the parametrised false-positive tests in
``tests/unit/test_validate_architecture.py``.

Stdlib-only on purpose: the script runs in CI before dependencies are
installed and must not import the plugin (which would execute store
constructors and touch the network).

Usage::

    python3 scripts/validate_architecture.py

Exit 0 when clean, 1 on a hard mismatch.

# --- Check 11: a promoted shared helper is defined exactly once ------------

#: Helpers that have been consolidated into one owning module, mapped to the
#: path (relative to ``py_modules/unifideck/``) that owns them.
#:
#: This is a hand-written list, which is normally the thing this script
#: exists to stamp out — but here the list *is* the deliverable. Audit §3.4
#: found five helpers copied across stores; three of them had silently
#: diverged, and one divergence (an install path that skipped its own
#: disk check) was a live defect. Promoting a helper into ``shared/`` does
#: nothing to stop the next store pasting its own copy back, and a grep for
#: the name finds the shared one and reads as covered. So: when a helper is
#: promoted, it gets a row here.
#:

#: ``# intentional-divergence: <reason>``. That is not a rubber stamp; it is
#: for the case where two same-named functions look like duplicates and are
#: not. There is exactly one today: Ubisoft implements the
#: ``store_injector`` hook ``_rebuild_auth_after_injection``, which the four
#: browser-auth stores get from the shared mixin, with a genuinely different
#: body — it has no browser monitor and wires a shortcut service instead.
#: §3.4 counted it as a fifth copy of the mixin's body; it never was one.
#: The same shape as §3.3's ``fix_pfx_symlink`` versus
#: ``ensure_pfx_symlink``, whose guards are inverses — that pair escapes
#: this check only because the two were given different names.

"""The local vault — a folder of archives read as a GameVault library.

This is the only module that knows local mode exists. It satisfies the two
seams in :mod:`.sources` (``CatalogSource`` and ``LocalVaultLocator``) and
everything downstream — the install pipeline, the executable finder, the
install marker, uninstall, the never-truncate library rule — is the same code
the remote server drives.

=====================

Drop game archives in this folder. They appear in your Steam library after
the next library sync (Unifideck -> Sync Library).

Supported archives
------------------
  .zip  .7z  .rar  .tar  .tar.gz  .tar.bz2  .tar.xz  .tar.zst  .iso  .wim
  .cab

Naming
------
Only the title is required:

  Stardew Valley.zip

Everything else is optional, in parentheses, and helps Unifideck match
artwork and pick the right launcher:

  Title (v1.5.0) (EA) (W_P) (2021).zip
         |        |    |     `- release year
         |        |    `------- W_P Windows game   L_P Linux game
         |        |             W_S Windows setup  L_SW Linux installer
         |        `------------ early access
         `--------------------- version

Games are identified by title and year, so replacing
"Stardew Valley (v1.5) (2016).zip" with "Stardew Valley (v1.6) (2016).zip"
updates the existing entry instead of creating a second one.

Subfolders one level deep are scanned too, which is useful for an SD card
mounted inside the vault.

This file and the .unifideck-vault marker beside it are safe to leave alone.
Removing the marker makes Unifideck treat the folder as missing, which
protects your library from being wiped when a drive fails to mount.

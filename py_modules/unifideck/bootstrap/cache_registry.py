"""bootstrap.cache_registry — declare every named cache used by the plugin.

Called during ``_main`` BEFORE ``auto_discover()`` runs the
store constructors, because some stores call ``is_available()``
during construction which reads from the cache. Missing the
registration would cause a ``KeyError`` the first time a store
asks for its cache slot.

The TTL table is the single source of truth for which caches
exist and how long their entries survive. TTL semantics (from
``CacheManager``):

  - ``0`` — unbounded lifetime, entry survives until explicit
    invalidation (used for IDs and maps that don't expire by
    time)
  - positive integer — seconds until entry becomes stale

Every store in ``_STORE_CACHES`` below also gets one cache slot,
all TTL=0 — they're used to memoize the
per-store ``is_available`` result inside a single plugin session
so we don't re-probe every RPC call.

# negative markers) still self-heal without user action — the old
# 1-day/7-day TTLs made every sync past the window silently re-pull

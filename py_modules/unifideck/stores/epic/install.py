"""Epic Games installer — install/uninstall pipeline using legendary.

``EpicInstaller`` orchestrates installs through ``legendary`` :

1. **preflight** — verify legendary binary, resolve base path, build
   the install context;
2. **probe** — call ``legendary info`` for the game's manifest
   (size, supported languages, executable path);
3. **subprocess** — spawn legendary with structured progress callbacks
   (parses legendary's stdout for "+ Downloaded: X/Y" lines);
4. **finalize** — resolve the launchable .exe (delegate to
   ``exe_resolver.py``), write the ``.unifideck-id`` marker,
   register with the install registry, regenerate manifest.

The uninstall path is symmetric : remove install dir, drop registry
entry, clean up shortcut + artwork cache, and run ``legendary
uninstall`` to keep legendary's bookkeeping in sync.

Errors at any phase are wrapped into typed ``InstallResult``
envelopes ; partial installs are cleaned up to avoid leaving
orphaned files on disk.

        ``legendary uninstall`` cannot be trusted to delete files: its
        per-game catalog lookup can fail with HTTP 401 (expired Epic
        auth), after which it **skips the deletion but still exits 0**,
        printing "please remove <path> manually". The old code only
        checked the exit code, so it reported success while leaving the
        full install (often many GiB) on disk.

        So we resolve the install dir from legendary's *local*
        ``installed.json`` (no network), run ``legendary uninstall`` only
        as best-effort metadata cleanup, then delete the directory and
        purge the registry entry ourselves — the latter is essential
        because a leftover entry makes the next library sync re-flag the
        game installed.

        The mechanics live in :mod:`unifideck.stores.epic.uninstall`;
        this method owns the ordering and what gets reported.
